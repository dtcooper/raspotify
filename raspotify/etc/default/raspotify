# To make your device visible on Spotify Connect across the Internet add your
# username and password which can be set via "Set device password", on your
# account settings, use `--username` and `--password`.
#
# To choose a different output device (ie a USB audio dongle or HDMI audio out),
# use `--device` with something like `--device hw:0,1`. Your mileage may vary.

# Uncomment to use a cache for downloaded audio files. Cache is disabled by

# permissions are properly set on the directory `/var/cache/raspotify'.

# By default, the volume normalization is enabled, add another volume argument
# here if you'd like, ie `VOLUME_ARGS=--initial-volume 100`.
